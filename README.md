# Uploading notes to X
- If you want to easily upload your session notes to X, you must create a free developer account.
- You must run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- I recommend, and I think you will find it easiest, to run this script after collecting multiple sessions into one note via the 'collect' cli command (but that is up to you).
